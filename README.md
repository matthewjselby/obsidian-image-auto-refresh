# Image Auto Refresh Plugin for Obsidian

This plugin watches for changes to files in an Obsidian vault and forces a refresh for images that have been modified on disk. Without this plugin, changes to images that are edited outside of Obsidian do not show up until the tab is closed and re-opened, or some kind of force-refresh is performed.
